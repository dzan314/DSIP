-Current (normal) screen resolution 2560x1600
-Switching to portrait rotates the screen 90 degrees; could be helpful for reading smartphone-sized images or probably reading/writing long pieces of code (on a monitor, for a laptop not that usefull..)
- after changing the resolution to 800x600 the image becomes pixelated, very hard to work with
